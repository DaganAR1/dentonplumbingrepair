            <h3>What Qualifies as a Plumbing Emergency?</h3>
            <p>Not all plumbing issues are emergencies, but some require immediate attention to prevent serious damage and costly repairs. Here are common plumbing emergencies that we handle:</p>
            <ul class="leak-repairs-benefits">
                <li><strong>Burst Pipes:</strong> A burst pipe can quickly flood your home, causing water damage to walls, floors, and personal belongings. Fast response is essential to limit the damage and avoid mold growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe Leaks:</strong> If you notice a major leak that cannot be controlled, it’s crucial to call an emergency plumber. Major leaks can waste hundreds of gallons of water, drive up your water bill, and damage your home’s structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Clogged Sewer Lines:</strong> A blocked sewer line can cause backups in multiple drains, leading to foul odors, sewage spills, and a health hazard. Immediate professional intervention is required to clear the blockage and prevent contamination.</li>
                <li><strong>Overflowing Toilets:</strong> An overflowing toilet can be messy, stressful, and unsanitary. If plunging doesn’t work, call us to quickly resolve the issue and restore your bathroom to working order.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Heater Failures:</strong> In cold weather, a broken water heater can be more than an inconvenience. We offer emergency repairs to restore your hot water quickly and ensure your comfort.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Line Leaks:</strong> If you smell gas, leave your home immediately and call emergency services, then reach out to us for professional gas line repair. Gas leaks are highly dangerous and should always be handled by licensed professionals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When in doubt, it’s best to call a professional. Addressing issues promptly helps prevent further damage and restores your peace of mind.</p>
