            <h3>Why Choose Professional Drain Cleaning Over DIY Methods?</h3>
            <p>While DIY methods and over-the-counter drain cleaners might seem convenient, they are often temporary solutions that can lead to further issues. Here’s why professional drain cleaning is the best choice:</p>
            <ul class="leak-repairs-benefits">
